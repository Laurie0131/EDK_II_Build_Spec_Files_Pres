Note:
So for file extensions <br>

-So first we have a DSC file this is for platform description. This is an extension of the existing DSC file from EDK 1.  This describes the build rules, libraries and components that are going to get Built. 
-We have the DEC file which is the Package Declaration. Each package has a package declaration or DEC file, and it declares all the interfaces that the package has.  This is one of the new files
Next we have INF file 	- Module Definition this is a description of one module and what it has
Next we have a FDF file -Flash Description File – this information used to be part of the original DSC file but has been split off into a new file. This describes which module or modules weather it was built as part of the DSC or included in a binary – it describes which module gets to go where in the flash – which one is comprised – which one goes in to recover - it is a or mapping of the flash device –
Next we have a DXS file which is a Dependency expression file -  this is used by the DXE and in PEI modules to Define what prerequisites they have before they can run
Finally we have the FV file - Firmware Volume image file - 
 
First four have a specification file located on tianocore.org.

@title[Package Declaration File]
#### <p align="right"><span class="gold" > Package Declaration File (DEC)</span></p>

Note:
One DEC file per package
Required for EDK II modules using extended INF and extended DSC format files 

The “ D” in DEC stands for “declaration”, as in package declaration file (DEC).
There is one DEC file for each package.
This file is required for using EDK II modules using the extended INF and extended DSC format files. 
If you make a new package you must have a DEC file for it.
SYNTAX -
The DEC has a defines section that says what this package is. It gives it a GUID and a name. Every other section described here is optional. 
It can have an includes section words saying “the include directories that this package has are as follows”. Then you would have some include directories. For example, you might be able to say this is my IA64 include and this is my X64 include, etc.
It has a library class section (optional). This exposes the library classes are defined in this package.
It has GUID section if there are any GUIDs that you have. Certain structures have GUIDs defines for them. If that structure is defined in this package, it would be listed there.
Each protocol for every protocol header file that is in your package you list.  You list the GUID of that protocol in the protocol section.
The same is true for PPIs; they are also identified by GUID.
PCD, if any module contained in your package defines a new PCD, this is where you tp look it up.
It is possible to reference a PCD from another package, but do not list it here. This location is for new PCDs.
Coincidentally,  as soon as you make a new PCD, you must make a new token space GUID, because all the PCDs are defined by a token space GUILD, followed by the PCD name. A new token space means you must have a GUID for the token space. So, any new PCDs are also going to have a GUID.
Finally, user extensions are rarely used but are optionally present. 



---?code=sample/OvmfPkg/OvmfPkg.dec&lang=shell&title=Example: DEC file

Note:
This is an Example DEC File

The name of this package is the Ovmf package. It has some GUIDs. In the includes.common section there is an include directory for this package called include, and that is where to locate all of the include files. 
In this example it finds a library class called LoadLinuxLib . The main interface for that is that it includes “Include/Library/  .h” 
We can see that it defines a GUID called “gUefiOvmfPkgTokenSpaceGuid” and it defines what the GUID value is.

Restrictions 
It is NOT permissible to list a Library Class entry under common and under a specific architecture. It is permissible to specify Library Class entries under all architectures except “common” if different header filename values are required for different architectures. 
Paths cannot contain indirect directory references outside of this package's directory tree (use of “..” is not allowed in a directory path name.)

- The FDF file
- This describes information about the flash part.
- It has rules for combining binaries built from a DSC file.
- You can create firmware images option ROM images for nearly anything you needed.
- It is possible to have the PCD information used in the definition, and also in some of the PCDs. The patchable ones will be stored at specific places inside the FV file. 
- Syntax:
- The FDF file has 
- a header and 
- a defines, 
- a FD section, 
- some number of FV sections.
- It might have a capsule,
- a VTF, rules, 
- an option ROM section if what you are trying to build is a PCI option on
- some user extensions.
